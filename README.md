This is the back-end repository for the remake of the wildfire tracker I made with [@rachelalk](https://github.com/rachelalk) during a one-day Couchbase Hackathon in August 2022.

I wanted to work a bit more with non-relational databases, and get some more practice in with back-end tech and testing.

Just getting things set up, will udpate this document more fully when things are a bit less messy!
