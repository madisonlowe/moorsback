This will be the back-end repository for the remake of the wildfire tracker I'm making from the Couchbase Hackathon I did in August 2022!

Taking a chance to experiment with another non-relational database, this time using MongoDB.

Going to work on the back-end first, before setting up the front: just getting things started!
